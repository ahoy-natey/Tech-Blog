# About

This is a site that allows you to post really anything, but is focused on Tech advice and tips from users who want to share their insights as well as information. This uses a number of dependencies, but primarily focuses on using Express, SQL, and Handlebars. Users can create a profile, then they can create posts which can be viewed on the homepage. At their profile, users can delete and edit posts.
